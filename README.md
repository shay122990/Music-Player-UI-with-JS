# Music Player UI

## About The Project

This a static music player UI for a phone screen.
In this project you can see that I'm using a locally stored media, but this is just to showcase the design and also learn JavaScript methods.
You can apply this to your projects or learn how to achieve this with vanilla JS.
In this project you can learn methods to calculate the song progress in minutes and seconds and display it in the progress bar.
Of course you have your play/pause buttons, along with next/previous buttons. The songs will play in a loop. You can also add and remove as many songs as you want.
As soon as the song ends, it will automatically play the next one. You can also click anywhere on the progress bar and it will play from there.
An added feature is the volume control and you can style it per your preference.

This is a working code example.
You can copy the CSS and Javascript code as is and use it in your projects.
Or you can download the code as a ZIP file and unzip it. No web server required, you can see it live through your localhost by opening index.html with your browser. Alternatively, you can open your project with VS Code (download live server extension) and click on **Go Live** at the bottom right corner, it should open in your default browser.
